# Parallel-BFS-with-Thread-Pools
This repository implements a parallelized Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph using thread pools and task queues in C. The code leverages multi-threading to explore graph vertices concurrently, improving performance on large graphs by taking advantage of multi-core processors.
